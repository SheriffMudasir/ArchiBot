# ArchiBot ü§ñ

ArchiBot is an AI-powered bot with extensive knowledge in architecture and building construction. It can answer questions, provide basic information, and offer detailed explanations on architecture-related topics. However, it politely declines any prompts that fall outside the scope of architecture and building construction. The bot is designed to assist users in exploring and understanding architectural concepts while recommending additional resources like books or websites for further learning.
